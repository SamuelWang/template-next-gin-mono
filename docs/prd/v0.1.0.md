- Add diagrams or references if needed.

## 6. Features & Requirements
For each feature include: description, user story, priority, acceptance criteria, dependencies.

- Feature A (Must)
  - User story: "As a [persona], I want to [action], so that [outcome]."
  - Acceptance criteria: list
  - Non-functional requirements: perf, security, availability
